// Binary Heaps
// very similar to binary search tree
// each parent has at most 2 child nodes
// all children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first
// no implied ordering between children
// Max Binary Heap - parent nodes are always LARGER than child nodes
// Min Binary Heap - parent nodes are always SMALLER than child nodes

class MaxBinaryHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.values = []
